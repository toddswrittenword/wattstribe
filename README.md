# wattstribe

## What is wattstribe?
Wattstribe is intended to be an open source method for creating online networking and entrepreneurial learning groups.  Wattstribe was borne out of a realization of how hard it is for isolated communities, such as rural entrepreneurs, veterans, and LGBT entrepreneurs, to network in a meaningful way.  By making networking virtual, wattstribe will close the distance between businesses, increasing survivability for small to mid-sized businesses.
